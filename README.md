# clockwork: simple CLI time tracker (v1.0.1)

clockwork is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help you track your time spent on different tasks. Whether youâ€™re working on personal projects, studying, or managing work tasks, clockwork makes it simple to log and visualize your time.

## Installation

### Running from Source

You'll need Python installed on your system for this.

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
    `git clone https://github.com/tferracina/clockwork.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Install the required dependencies.
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## File Storage

clockwork stores its data in a SQLite database located in a .clockwork directory in your home folder. The file timelog.db will be created to keep track of your logs.


## Usage

If you're using the executable, replace `python clockwork.py` with the path to the executable in the following commands.

### clockin

The command `clockin` is how you start tracking the time. You must provide a category, activity, and a task. Optionally, add notes with `--notes`.
```
clockin category activity task --notes "optional notes"
```
Examples:
```
clockin study exercise physics
clockin coding timetrack testing --notes "test"
clockin work research image-preprocessing-tools
```

### clockout

The clock is stopped with `clockout` command. Provide the activity, and again, optionally add notes.
```
clockout activity --notes "optional notes"
```
Example:
```
clockout physics --notes "finished exercise set 3"
```

### clocklog

Displays the log of your tracked hours. A date range can be provided, if not, your full log will be returned. Format in YYYY-MM-DD
```
clocklog start-date end-date
clocklog 2024-01-01 2024-12-31
```

### clockvis

Saves a visualization of your hours for a specified date range. Format in YYYY-MM-DD
In addition, a category can be specified with --category

In a config.py file, it is possible to create a COLOR_DICT to specify what colors you prefer for different categories.
```
clockvis stard-date end-date
clockvis 2024-01-01 2024-12-31 --category coding

COLOR_DICT = {"school": "green", "personal": "yellow"}
```

### clockcsv

Download your logs in csv format with a specified date range. Format in YYYY-MM-DD
In addition, a category can be specified with --category
```
clockcsv stard-date end-date
clockcsv 2024-01-01 2024-12-31 --category coding
```


### Future Features:
```
clocklog daily
clocklog weekly
clocklog monthly
```


## Creating Aliases

To make the commands shorter, you can create aliases. This step is optional, especially if you're using the executable.

On macos using zsh:
```
open ~/.zshrc
```
Then add an alias as:
```
alias clockin='path/to/python path/to/clockwork.py clockin'
```
And finally restart your terminal with:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

This step is optional but can make the commands shorter and easier to use.
