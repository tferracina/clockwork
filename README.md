# clockwork: simple CLI time tracker (v1.1.0)

clockwork is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help you track your time spent on different tasks. Whether youâ€™re working on personal projects, studying, or managing work tasks, clockwork makes it simple to log and visualize your time.

## Installation

### Running from Source

You'll need Python installed on your system for this.

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
    `git clone https://github.com/tferracina/clockwork.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Install the required dependencies.
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## File Storage

clockwork stores its data in a SQLite database located in a .clockwork directory in your home folder. The file `timelog.db` will be created to keep track of your logs. Configuration settings are stored in `config.json` in the same directory.


## Usage

### clockin

The command `clockin` is how you start tracking the time.
You must provide a category, activity, and a task. Optionally, add notes with `--notes`.
```
python clockwork.py clockin <category> <activity> <task> [--notes "optional notes"]
```
Examples:
```
clockin study exercise physics
clockin coding timetrack testing --notes "test"
clockin work research image-preprocessing-tools
```

### clockout

The clock is stopped with `clockout` command. Provide the activity, and again, optionally add notes.
```
python clockwork.py clockout <activity> [--notes "optional notes"]
```
Example:
```
clockout physics --notes "finished exercise set 3"
```

### clocklog

Displays the log of your tracked hours. A date range can be specified using a single-letter code.
```
python clockwork.py clocklog [date_range]
```
Date range options:

`d`: daily (today)
`w`: weekly (current week)
`m`: monthly (current month)
`y`: yearly (current year)

If no date range is specified, it defaults to weekly.


### clocksum

Displays the total duration for each category. A date range can be specified using a single-letter code.
```
python clockwork.py clocksum [date_range]
```
Same date range options as clocklog. If no date range is specified, it defaults to weekly.


### clockvis

Saves a visualization of your hours for a specified date range. You must provide start and end dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.
In addition, a category can be specified with `--category`.

In a `config.json` file, it is possible to create a COLOR_DICT to specify what colors you prefer for different categories.
```
python clockwork.py clockvis --start-date <YYYY-MM-DD> --end-date <YYYY-MM-DD> [--category <category>]
```

### clockcsv

Download your logs in CSV format with a specified date range. You must provide start and end dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.
In addition, a category can be specified with `--category`.
```
python clockwork.py clockcsv <start-date> <end-date> [--category <category>]
```


## Configuration

The `config.json` file in the `.clockwork` directory allows you to customize various aspects of the application:

- `color_dict`: Specify colors for different categories in visualizations
- `database`: Set the path for the SQLite database
- `default_date_range`: Set the default date range for reports
- `csv_export`: Configure CSV export settings
- `visualization`: Set default chart type and figure size
- `time_format`: Specify the time format used in logs
- `categories`: List of predefined categories
- `notification`: Enable and configure reminders
- `backup`: Configure automatic backups of your data

Please keep in mind some of these features still need to be implemented.


## Creating Aliases

To make the commands shorter, you can create aliases.

On macos using zsh:
```
open ~/.zshrc
```
Then add an alias as:
```
alias clockin='path/to/clockwork.py clockin'
```
And finally restart your terminal with:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

This step is optional but can make the commands shorter and easier to use.
